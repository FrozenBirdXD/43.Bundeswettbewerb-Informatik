This repository contains my personal solutions and final submissions for tasks from the Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (BWINF), the national computer science competition in Germany.

### Achievements

**1st Round:**
- I achieved a 2nd prize with a score of 13 out of 15 points.

**2nd Round:**
- I scored 42 out of 40 points (bonus points possible). This also earned me a 2nd prize.
- A score of 43 would have qualified for a 1st prize and an invitation to the final round â€” so I was very close ._.

Despite not making it to the final round, I was invited to the BWINF Research Days at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, which I will attend in June 2025.
